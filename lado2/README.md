This is a simple platform that I started as hobby project for a friend of mine.
He was always interested in learning new languages and wanted to have a simple search engine
that he could insert words or phrases in different languages and time after that he could search them
easy by some word/words that he reminds from the inserted phrase.
The phrases can also if its preferred from the admin to be classified with categories.
Also it is possible to connect a phrase with an image if you are the type of person who memorises and connects things
with images. (A more visual learner person).
The admin always has the possibility to make changes after the insertation (modify or delete phrases or categories or images).

Default Username/Password are:

Username: lado
Password: eraldo

Technical description.

This platform is written using only Php, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.
Compatible with PHP7.0
Needs a module of Php called Php-gd to make the image/phrase feature functional. Without that module the platform will crash everytime you want to upload an image and connect it with a phrase.

For ease, I made a bash script that will automate the creation of the right environment for the platform to work.
After that you are free to use the App.

(Bash script complatible only with Debian like linux distros.)
